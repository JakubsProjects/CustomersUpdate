# CustomersUpdate
This is a program which takes in two files, customers and transactions. 
Then behind the scenes it updates each customers bank account balance. In this project I use a Customer class in c++ to intialize
a constructor, make setter funtions, getter functions, and a check balance function.

You must enter either file customers01.csv & transactions01.csv
or must enter customers02.csv & transactions02.csv. You can cannot cross and mix customers01.csv with transactions02.csv as
the customers and transactions would not match.
